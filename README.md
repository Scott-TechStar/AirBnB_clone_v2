<h1 align="center">AirBnB Clone Project</h1>

## Description :house:

AirBnB Clone is a complete RESTful web application, integrating file and
database (MySQL) storage in a back-end API with front-end interfacing in a
clone of AirBnB. The front-end is designed using HTML5/CSS3 and is served using
Python Flask. The application is configured on a distributed system - two web
servers and one load balancer - with Nginx and HAProxy.

AirBnB Clone is still in active development, with complete functionality set to
deploy in the coming month:

* Complete integration of a RESTful API
* Full configuration of website with domain name
* Serving of dynamic content using JavaScript

## MESSAGE TO ANYONE VIEWING THIS CONTENT 

I'd like to present this web application as the culmination of my full-stack education at Holberton School, showcasing the skills I've acquired during my time here.

It's important to note that while this project is substantial, it is still a work in progress. The deployment of a fully functional RESTful API is currently underway and will be completed within the next month, coinciding with my final phase at Holberton.

Now, let me provide some more context about this AirBnB clone. This repository represents the second iteration of the project. The initial version (accessible [here](https://github.com/Scott-TechStar/AirBnB_clone)) was developed in collaboration with a fellow cohort member. We built the initial file storage back-end and console entirely from scratch, engaging in pair programming for most of the work in this version.

For this second iteration, I worked with a new partner and inherited a different version of the same back-end, which had been initially developed by a pair of Holberton students from a previous cohort. We then engaged in pair programming to enhance the database storage engine of the back-end.

Between these two versions, I independently crafted a complete CSS-styled HTML web page for the project. While the HTML files I authored are primarily found in [version one](https://github.com/Scott-TechStar/AirBnB_clone), please note that the [web_static](./web_static) folder in this directory was included in the fork. Additionally, all Shell, Puppet, and Fabric deployment scripts and manifests were authored by me.

I took the lead in writing the READMEs for both repositories.

I hope this clarifies the project's status. I apologize for any confusion regarding the versioning, but the key takeaway is that I have been directly involved in coding at least one implementation of every aspect in this repository. After all, software development wouldn't be complete without a touch of intricate version control, right? :sweat_smile: :sob:

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out!

### Static :page_facing_up:

The front-end of AirBnB Clone was designed from scratch using HTML5/CSS3 pages
integrated using Flask. While the front-end has not yet been officially deployed,
screenshots are viewable in the README of the [web_flask](./web_flask) directory.

### Classes :cl:

AirBnB Clone supports the following classes:

* BaseModel
* User
* State
* City
* Amenity
* Place
* Review

## Storage :baggage_claim:

The above classes are handled by one of either two abstracted storage engines,
depending on the call - [FileStorage](./models/engine/file_storage.py) or
[DBStorage](./models/engine/db_storage.py).

### FileStorage

The default mode.

In `FileStorage` mode, every time the backend is initialized, HolbertonBnB
instantiates an instance of `FileStorage` called `storage`. The `storage`
object is loaded/re-loaded from any class instances stored in the JSON file
`file.json`. As class instances are created, updated, or deleted, the
`storage` object is used to register corresponding changes in the `file.json`.

### DBStorage

Run by setting the environmental variables `HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db`.

In `DBStorage` mode, every time the backend is initialized, HolbertonBnB
instantiates an instance of `DBStorage` called `storage`. The `storage` object
is loaded/re-loaded from the MySQL database specified in the environmental variable
`HBNB_MYSQL_DB`, using the user `HBNB_MYSQL_USER`, password `HBNB_MYSQL_PWD`, and
host `HBNB_MYSQL_HOST`. As class instances are created, updated, or deleted, the
`storage` object is used to register changes in the corresponding MySQL database.
Connection and querying is achieved using SQLAlchemy.

Note that the databases specified for `DBStorage` to connect to must already be
defined on the MySQL server. This repository includes scripts
[setup_mysql_dev.sql](./setup_mysql_dev.sql) and [setup_mysql_test.sql](./setup_mysql_test.sql)
to set up `hbnb_dev_db` and `hbnb_test_db` databases in a MySQL server,
respectively.

## Console :computer:

The console is a command line interpreter that permits management of the backend
of AirBnB Clone. It can be used to handle and manipulate all classes utilized by
the application (achieved by calls on the `storage` object defined above).

### Using the Console

The AirBnB Clone console can be run both interactively and non-interactively.
To run the console in non-interactive mode, pipe any command(s) into an execution
of the file `console.py` at the command line.

```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  all  count  create  destroy  help  quit  show  update

(hbnb)
$
```

Alternatively, to use the HolbertonBnB console in interactive mode, run the
file `console.py` by itself:

```
$ ./console.py
```

Remember, the console can be run with `storage` instantiated in either `FileStorage`
or `DBStorage` mode. The above examples instantiate `FileStorage` by default, but
`DBStorage` can be instantiated like so:

```
$ HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_dev HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_dev_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_dev_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db ./console.py
```

The console functions identically regardless of the `storage` mode.

While running in interactive mode, the console displays a prompt for input:

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb)
```

To quit the console, enter the command `quit`, or input an EOF signal
(`ctrl-D`).

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) quit
$
```

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) EOF
$
```

### Console Commands

The AirBnB Clone console supports the following commands:

#### create
* Usage: `create <class> <param 1 name>=<param 1 value> <param 2 name>=<param 2 value> ...`

Creates a new instance of a given class. The class' ID is printed and
the instance is saved to the file `file.json`. When passing parameter key/value
pairs, any underscores contained in value strings are replaced by spaces.

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) create BaseModel
119be863-6fe5-437e-a180-b9892e8746b8
(hbnb)

`id`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`).

```

## Testing :straight_ruler:

Unittests for the AirBnB Clone project are defined in the [tests](./tests)
folder. To run the entire test suite simultaneously, execute the following command:

```
$ python3 unittest -m discover tests
```

Alternatively, you can specify a single test file to run at a time:

```
$ python3 unittest -m tests/test_console.py
```
